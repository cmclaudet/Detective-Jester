Recruiter: Hey, you must be the new jester! We are soooooo excited to have you here. I'm the chamberlain of this castle. Head of HR if you'd like! Haha.

Recruiter: I have penciled you in for entertaining our king this evening! He is very easy-going, don't worry. You can joke about absolutely anything!

Recruiter: Explore the castle and our staff while you wait for your turn.
