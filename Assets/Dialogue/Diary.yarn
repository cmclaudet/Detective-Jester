The Kings DIary: It's me, the king! I missed writing in you.Today was neat. Had some totally lame jesters though. Like, seriously?
The Kings DIary:One had the gall to joke about uncle Bartholomew. Like, out of the red. But I got to pet a pony. A totally real pony! He didn't even bite.

The Kings Diary: TUESDAY: Dear Diary, Me again!
The Kings DIary: King Mangold one castle over has much better jesters. I guess the grass is always bluer, huh?
The Kings DIary: Still, so unfair. But I like him. I like all of Kerven. People make fun of them but they are like so cool! He let me use his x-box.
