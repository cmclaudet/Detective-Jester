King: I thought you'd be funny...

    -> I might not be that funny, but I’m still funnier than I look!
        King: You don’t seem to put a lot of value on yourself.
        <<loseLife 1>>
        <<jump Question3>>

        King: What are you talking about? You make no sense. Are you mocking me?
        <<loseLife 1>>
        <<jump Question3>>

    -> You seem to have a great sense of humor yourself. I assume these jesters around us died from laughter?
        King: No, I don’t think that was the reason? Do you have a point to make?

Jester: How often do the people of the Orkovan kingdom shower?

        <<getLaugh 1>> 
        <<jump Question5>>

    -> Once in a green moon
        King: That’s not how the saying goes… You’re mocking me, aren’t you?
