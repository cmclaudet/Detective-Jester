Guard: Behind me is the throne room of our glorious king. It's even more beautiful in there than in the Duckingham Palace.

Guard: His majesty is a great leader, and a man of impeckable taste.

Guard: We don't have any more jesters lined up for today, just this annoying lying one back there...

Guard: All the others weren't a hoot. The king had no other choice than to 'let them fly'.

<<playSound tamas_medium_1>>
