Guard: I am the head of the royal guard. You may address me as Sir, or not address me at all.
Guard: Behind me is the throne room of our glorious king. It's even more beautiful in there than in the Duckingham Palace.
Guard: His majesty is a great leader, and a man of impeckable taste.
Guard: Our lady queen is the most beautiful woman in the entire kingdom, she has such a pheasant voice.
Guard: I can't believe that one of your colleagues here tried to make a joke about her nose. That's so cheep. Of course, he got the axe.
Guard: I am on duty here. Why don't you bother somebody else now.

Guard: It is your turn, comedi-hen. The king awaits. You're sure you're ready for this?

Guard: It's owl or nothing. There will be no nest time.
